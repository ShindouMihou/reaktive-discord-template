# Reaktive Discord Template

Built for Javacord, this template is a simple way to get started with a Discord bot using Reakt and Nexus 
to build highly reactive, and simple Discord bots in Kotlin.

You may read the following resources about the libraries used in this template:
1. [Reakt.discord](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/reakt.discord): A rendering framework abstraction on top of Javacord that enables 
swift, and simple reactive rendering of Discord messages, this is inspired by Svelte and React.js, but built for Kotlin. Highly recommended
for Discord bots that require heavy reactivity (updating a message whenever the user interacts with it).
2. [Nexus](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Nexus): A object-based framework on top of Javacord that simplifies Discord bot 
development with its massive featureset and simplified application command design.
3. [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord): The Discord bot library itself, it is recommended to learn this first
before fully delving onto the different frameworks when possible.

## Projects Built with this Template

This template is used by various projects under Qucy, such as:
1. [Threadscore](https://threadscore.mihou.pw): A Discord bot that gamifies question and answering to encourage community members to help each other out.
2. [Flyght](https://flyght.mihou.pw): A Discord bot that brings membership questions (similar to Facebook Groups) to enable server owners to know their members better.

It is also used to build several other private Discord bots that are not listed here.
